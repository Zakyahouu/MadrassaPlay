Here i will explain as much as i can from what i am doing to constract this project
first this project about platform where u can make games for students hosted by teacher; each game made in bundle where this bundle controlled by admin,

The stack taken is mern, react next.js mongodb 

#### Create the work folder i named this project madrassaplay, inside it had 2 folders, client and server,
front-end, back end.

### inside the server folder, open terminal and initialize the Node.js project
using command npm init -y (node package manager, init means initialize and -y means skip all the options will be given and just get default options)
this command will create package json will contain project details and dependencies

### next is install the packages (core packages) for the project backend
npm install : 
-express ==> main frame work for building the API
-mongoose ==> library helps talking to our MongoDB 
-cors ==> will allow the frontend to communicate with backend
-dotenv ==> let us use .env file that will help us secure and store secret informations like database connections strings
-nodemon ==> let us restart the server each time we save a file, helps lessen consumtion of time

so far are these the fondations for our server

### after that, create a file name it server.js, this file will be the main entry point for the entire backend
here a segmenet of the code with some explanation: 
// 1. IMPORT PACKAGES
// 'require' is the Node.js way of importing a package into a file.
// We are importing the 'express' package we installed earlier.
const express = require('express');

// 2. INITIALIZE THE APP
// We are creating an instance of the Express application.
// The 'app' object will be used to configure our server.
const app = express();

// We define a port number for our server to listen on.
// process.env.PORT is for when we deploy online. For local development,
// it will default to 5000 if PORT isn't specified elsewhere.
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

// 3. DEFINE A TEST ROUTE
// ==============================================================================
// A "route" is a specific URL endpoint on our server.
// app.get('/', ...) means "When someone makes a GET request to the root URL ('/'),
// execute the following function."
// The function takes a request (req) and a response (res) object.
// res.send(...) sends a response back to the browser.
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from the MadrassaPlay API!');
});

// 4. START THE SERVER
// ==============================================================================
// This command tells our app to start listening for incoming requests on the specified PORT.
// The function inside is a callback that runs once the server has successfully started.
// We use console.log to print a message in our terminal so we know it's working.
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port: ${PORT}`);
});



////////************//////////



// server/config/db.js

// 1. IMPORT MONGOOSE
// ==============================================================================
// Mongoose is the package that will help us communicate with our MongoDB database.
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// 2. CREATE THE DATABASE CONNECTION FUNCTION
// ==============================================================================
// We are creating an 'async' function. This allows us to use the 'await' keyword,
// which is necessary because connecting to a database is an asynchronous operation
// (it takes some time to complete).
const connectDB = async () => {
  try {
    // This is the core of the connection. mongoose.connect() attempts to connect
    // to the MongoDB database using the connection string provided.
    // process.env.MONGO_URI is how we will access our secret connection string.
    const conn = await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI, {
      // These are standard options to prevent console warnings.
      useNewUrlParser: true,
      useUnifiedTopology: true,
    });

    // If the connection is successful, we log a message to the console.
    // conn.connection.host will show the database host we are connected to.
    console.log(`MongoDB Connected: ${conn.connection.host}`);
  } catch (error) {
    // If there is an error during connection, we log the error message.
    console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);
    // process.exit(1) will exit the Node.js process with a failure code.
    // This is important because if we can't connect to the database, our app can't run.
    process.exit(1);
  }
};

// 3. EXPORT THE FUNCTION
// ==============================================================================
// module.exports is the Node.js way of making a function or object from one file
// available to be used in another file.
module.exports = connectDB;
